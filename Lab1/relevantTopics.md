After this lab, you should be _conversant_ in the following areas. Deliverable: write up little elevator-pitch-length responses to questions such as the following.


* [x] read the chapters from the Business Analytics book that will help you answer questions such as the following:
	* [x] what is business analytics?
    * Business analytics combines the fields of management, business and computer science. The business aspect requires both a high-level understanding of the business as well as the practical limitations that exist.
    The analytical part requires an understanding of data, statistics and computer science. The combination of these two things allows for a business analyst to draw insights from analytical techniques and be able to interpret them to high level managers.
	* [x] why learn about business analytics if the job role won't be an analyst -- what job roles involve analytics?
    * Many - if not all - fields today in business involve some sort of data component. Companies are using analytics to draw larger insights on every aspect of the business. This could include personnel, marketing, finance, etc. It is important to understand business
    analytics because even as a non-analyst, it is important to understand the concepts.
	* [x] what is predictive analytics? what is supervised analytics, and what is unsupervised analytics?
    * Predictive analytics is the process of using historical data to predict new data in the future. Supervised analytics is a form of predictive analytics that is used when your target variable (the variable you want to predict) has a known value. For example, we want to predict "price" or we want
    to predict if credit card activity is fradulent or not (1 or 0). Unsupervised Analytics is used when we do not know anything about the groups or "labels" in the data set. A good example is using customer data to segment customers into
    different groups.
	* [x] what is a target? what are features? What are dependent variables, and independent variables?
    * A target refers to the variable we are trying to predict or test for. An example might be Sales Price when looking at housing data.
    * Features refer to "predictors". Variables we include into our model.
    * Dependent variables are in essence also the same as the target variable.
    * Independent variables are in essence also the same as Features or Predictors.
	* [x] what is a model?
    * A model is a mathematical equation that describes relationships among variables in a historical data set
* [x] what is jupyter, how does it relate to python, where can one find a jupyter, contrast with anaconda and local notebooks
  * Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
* [x] what is AWS, what is sagemaker, how does it compare with google Colab
  * Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. SageMaker removes the heavy lifting from each step of the machine learning process to make it easier to develop high quality models.
  * Google Colab allows for Python Jupyter notebooks to be run on the cloud. Colab is free to use. It comes loaded with many popular packages from Python.
